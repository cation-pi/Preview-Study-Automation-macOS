# Preview-Study-Automation-macOS

A small shell script to automate opening my study materials. This mini project helps me quickly start my study session with all the right PDFs opened and ready in Preview (macOS).  

## Features
- Launches different subjects from a simple menu.
- Opens PDFs directly in macOS Preview, one window per subject.
- Each subject's files are grouped as tabs inside its own window.
- Automatically goes fullscreen.
- Easily customizable with your own files.

## Usage
- Make the script executable:
  chmod +x open-materials.sh
- Run it:
  ./open-materials.sh
- Choose a subject number.

## Customization
The file paths in open-materials.sh are placeholders.
Replace them with the actual path to your study materials (e.g. "$HOME/path/to/your/materials/xx.pdf").
You can add as many subjects and files as you want by modifying the script.
You can also create an alias in your shell config for more quick access.
